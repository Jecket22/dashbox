# dashbox
A new\* GDPS source code, written for ease of use and packing a whole lot of new features, allowing anyone with little knowledge to do a lot with their GDPS in unique ways.

*Please note that this is **__a__ GDPS core**, not **__the__ GDPS core**. I personally am not looking to compete with other GDPS cores or pity on such which lack features, functionality or are just written in a different programming language.  
My goal with this project is to give people a chance into trying something completely different, without the need to choose a different hosting service or method in comparison to what's normally used to host a GDPS.*

## Notice (overlooked by too many to count)
Most features are **NOT** working, so please don't expect that everything is working out of the box!  
I advise you to not use this for a public server until a **full** release comes up.

### Requirements
- php 8.0+ (tested on 8.1)
- MySQL or MariaDB (tested on MariaDB 10.3.35)

### Credits (futuristic)
- Cvolton and Wylie for various code and some tips
- GD Programming Discord and its GDDocs project
- External libraries are also credited respectively in their files
